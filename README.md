# SVG Logo Generator
## Description
This application is a command line interface (CLI) tool that allows the user to generate a simple SVG logo using command line prompts. A video demonstration of the application can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/18NvgRYWB3h8CSICx-V8k8tjTC9fSr8xA).


## Installation

Fork or clone this repository to your local machine. You must ensure that the inquirer package is installed in order for the application to work properly.

## Usage

From the root directory, run node index.js to begin the series of prompts. Upon completion, the user will be informed that the SVG logo was created. It will be found in the root directory.

The user can also test the application's basic functions by running 'npm test'.

<b>Any previous logo.svg files in that directory will be overwritten if they share the same name!</b>
